<h1>OMS React App</h1>

I developed an efficient Order Management System (OMS) web app using Django. The feature-rich OMS page includes essential functionalities such as login, registration, and password reset. 

Seamlessly interacting with a PostgreSQL database, it provides forms for managing order records in a tabular format. To enhance versatility, I integrated a Django Rest Framework API for external access to order data. 

ReactJS for front-end development ensured an engaging user interface, while the Rest API facilitated smooth data exchange between the front-end and Django backend.

This comprehensive tech stack guarantees the robustness and optimal performance of the OMS web application.
