I developed and deployed an efficient Order Management System (OMS) web app using Django. The feature-rich OMS page includes essential functionalities such as login, registration, and password reset. 
Seamlessly interacting with a PostgreSQL database, it provides forms for managing order records in a tabular format. To enhance versatility, I integrated a Django Rest Framework API for external access to order data. 
ReactJS for front-end development ensured an engaging user interface, while the Rest API facilitated smooth data exchange between the front-end and Django backend.
This comprehensive tech stack guarantees the robustness and optimal performance of the OMS web application.

How To Run?
step 1: Go to oms-react-app
        Run this command in terminal 'cd oms-react-app' from the root directory.
step 2: Start the React server.
        Run this command 'npm start' to start the server.
step 3: go to 'Backend' directory.
        Run this command from the backend directory 'python manage.py runserver' to start django server.
step 4: Open 'localhost:3000' to view the page.
