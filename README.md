<h1>OMS React App</h1>

I crafted an efficient Order Management System (OMS) web app using Django. The OMS page boasts essential features like login, registration, and password reset.

Interacting seamlessly with a PostgreSQL database, it provides user-friendly forms for managing order records in a tabular format. To enhance versatility, I seamlessly integrated a Django Rest Framework API, allowing external access to order data.

For the front-end development, ReactJS ensured an engaging user interface, while the Rest API facilitated smooth data exchange between the front-end and Django backend.

This comprehensive tech stack ensures the robustness and optimal performance of the OMS web application.
